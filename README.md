# Autoplaylists for Google Musicâ„¢

This is a Chrome extension that allows for user-defined autoplaylists in Google Music (iTunes calls these "Smart Playlists").

**This extension is not supported nor endorsed by Google.**

Here's a video of what it looks like right now: [dropbox video link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jff4yd7zepvfrdg/google%20music%20autoplaylists.mov?dl=0).

It's very early in development and only available from source.
If you're interested in using it once it's more polished, sign up for the mailing list at
 https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/autoplaylists-for-google-music.
I'll announce when it's available in the Chrome Web Store.

## Usage

### Installation
* download and extract this repo (or clone it), then `cd` to it
* run `npm install`
* run `./build.sh`
* go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
* click "developer mode"
* click "Load unpacked extension" and provide the downloaded repo

### Use
* open a tab to https://play.google.com/music/listen
* click the extension's "page action": the tiny icon in the far right of the url bar, to the left of the bookmark star
* playlists are updated whenever their definition changes, periodic changes coming soon

### How it works
* your library is pulled from a Google Music IndexedDB (or Google's servers as a fallback)
* your tracks are indexed in an in-memory [lovefield](https://github.com/google/lovefield) database
* ~~differential updates are polled for periodically~~ this doesn't actually happen yet
* playlist definitions are stored in chrome.storage.sync

## Development
* follow "Installation from source" directions
* run `./watch.sh` somewhere and leave it running -- this will build whenever files change
* after updating any javascript, hit "reload" in [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
* log locations:

    * content script: music.google.com console
    * background script: click the "background page" link by the "Inspect views" section on chrome://extensions/
    * manager/playlist: on their pages
